# KImages

## Overview
This library is built off of [processing](https://processing.org) and creates 
some added functionality. While the functionality presented is mostly suited for a game, there is a large
number of different things in processing this would be used for.
- Supports a wider range of file types (Everything supported by [Java Advanced Imaging](https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-core))
- Images with basic physics and transformation capabilities
- Adds collision detection between images
